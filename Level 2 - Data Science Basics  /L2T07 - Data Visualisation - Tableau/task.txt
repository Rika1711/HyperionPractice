2) Do companies that have been on this list longer have a higher chance of appearing again in this list?

It is not likely that companies that have been on the list longer have a higher chance of appearing again. 
As you can see in the graph 'Growth by Years on List', companies that have been on the list for less amount of time, experience a way higher
amount of growth on average than companies that have been on the list for longer. 
Since the list is composed of only the top 5000 fastest growing companies, you can deduce that it is not more likely for companies that have been
on the list for longer to appear again.

3) Does the number of workers in the company affect the growth of the company?

There is no strong effect of number of workers on the growth of companies. The graph 'Growth by Amount of Workers' shows the relationship between workers and growth.
The bigger the field, the bigger the growth of the company. The shade of the fields indicates the amount of workers: The darker the field, the more workers are employed.
The graph shows that the companies with the largest amount of growth, have a diverse number of workers. Some companies have 200-300 workers, others have over 700 workers.

However, it is also visible most companies with the largest number of workers (around 30.000 and more) have a lower amount of growth (as compared to other companies on this list).
