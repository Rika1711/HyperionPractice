 Compulsory Task 1

 State whether the mean, median, or mode would be useful in the following scenarios:
 
 1) You are doing population statistics. You are asked to give an estimate
 of the typical income of a single person in the country. There is one
 snag: wealth distribution is out of whack, and 10% of the population
 holds 70% of the nation’s wealth.
 - median

 2) You are running a restaurant, and you are reviewing your menu.You
 have a list of all orders over the last six months. You are trying to find
 out which item you should keep based on what customers seem to
 like the most.
 - mode

 3) You have been buying electricity once a month for the first six months
 of the year. You are trying to budget your electricity for the rest of the
 year and therefore need to estimate how much you will spend for the
 remainder of the year.
 - mean

 4) You work in healthcare insurance. You are asked to provide an estimate
 of the typical amount of money spent on healthcare. This is taking into
 account the fact that there are a few people who spend a large
 amount of money on medical healthcare due to major issues.
 - median

State whether you would use variance or standard deviation to inform the
following decisions:

1) You are choosing a new Internet provider. You find two providers with
the same mean speed, but you want to have a more stable connection.
You get a list of all reported speeds over the last month and are trying
to find the provider that doesn’t move too much from the mean value.
- variance

2) You are going on holiday to Mauritius. You need to find a shuttle from
the airport to your hotel, but you are worried about being overcharged
or undercharged (being undercharged might mean that you get
unreliable transport). You get a list of all available shuttle service prices
and need to find out which services, if any, are overcharging or
undercharging.
- standard deviation
