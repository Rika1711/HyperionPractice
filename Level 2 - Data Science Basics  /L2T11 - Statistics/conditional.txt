Compulsory Task 2

P(A and B) = P(B|A) P(A)
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) P(A)) / P(B)

Give the values of P(B) and P(A and B) in the following scenarios. You are
welcome to calculate P(A|B) if you choose to do so:

1) You work for a risk analysis insurer. You have read that this year, out of
all drivers on the road, 5% have had accidents under the age of 25. You
have also read that 10% of all drivers are under the age of 25. A new
client approaches you and states that their age is 22. You want to
calculate the chance that this driver has had an accident this year
based on their age.

P(B)        = 10%
P(A and B)  = 5% (of all drivers 5% had an accident and were under 25)
P(A|B)      = P(A and B) / P(B)
            = .05 / 0.1 = .5
            = 50%

2) Your friend told you that they would buy you lunch if you can flip a coin
and have it land on heads twice. You flip it the first time, and it lands on
heads. What are your chances now of it landing on heads again?

P(B)        = 50%
P(A and B)  = 25% (50% * 50%)
P(A|B)      = 50% (each flip is independent)

3) You were always told that knowing Maths helps you to achieve 80% in
Computer Science. You read some statistics showing that 30% of all
Computer Science graduates took Maths and achieved 80%. Overall,
60% of all Computer Science graduates took Maths. Considering you
took Maths, what are your chances of achieving 80%?

P(B)        = 60%
P(A and B)  = 30%
P(A|B)      = P(A and B) / P(B)
            = .3 / .6 = .5
            = 50%

4)  This is a mock study created using a total of 100 participants. The two orange
areas show the total number of people who actually have COVID, and the two
blue areas show the total number of people who donâ€™t actually have COVID.
The two darkly-coloured areas at the bottom show the people who tested
positive for COVID. The two lightly-coloured areas show the people who
tested negative for COVID.

H: A person has Covid.
E: a positive Covid test

P(H)    = 70 / 100 
        = .7
        = 70%

P(E|H)  = .63 / .7 
        = .9
        = 90%  

P(E)    = (63 + 1) / 100
        = .64
        = 64%

P(H|E)  = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)
        = .9 * .7 / .64
        = .984
        = 98.4%
There is a 98.4% chance that a person has covid if they have a positive test.
