    - better end-user productivity - Being able to turn data into useful information helps users make better and quicker decisions.

3. Explain the difference between data and information.
- data: Data are raw facts that on their own don't help decision making. That is because no processing happened yet to reveal the data's meaning.
- information: Information is processed data. That processing of raw data reveals their meaning.
